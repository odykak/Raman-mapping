Reads Raman spectroscopy data (of carbonaceous material) taken on a square area of tested material and contour plots D/G intensity ratio, fitting D and G peak using a lorentzian function.

"Code" is the file to run, found in the branch named "main".

Example data can be found in the branch named "Data".

Created graph can be found in the branch named "Graphs".
